Oakville Heritage Properties
============================

This sample application was written for the *Microsoft Virtual Academy* named **Cross Platform Development with Xamarin & Visual Studio**

The goal of the Microsoft Virtual Academy is to build an iOS, Android and Windows Phone app from start to finish with the end goal of sharing as much C# code as possible across the three platforms. 

The sample app to be built is called Heritage Properties and uses <a href="http://oakville.ca/data/">OpenData from the Town of Oakville</a>. The app will display all heritage property locations in list form and map form as well as display details of the heritage property.

All modules build on top of each other and start off building separate platform apps. As modules progress, common code will be shared across platforms to reduce code duplication and an MVVM pattern will be leveraged throughout. The two module will focus on testing your new apps using Xamarin Test Cloud to make sure your app works across a wide range of devices making sure your users are getting the best experience possible. 

At the end of all the modules you should have a good introduction to Xamarin and how to use with Visual Studio 2013 and start building your cross platform apps!
